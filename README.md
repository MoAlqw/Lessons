All applications are educational, the main part is written according to the book "Android Programming: 
The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (4th Edition)" with independent assignments, except for the last two applications.

The main topics that are covered:

Kotlin is the language on which all training is built.

Activity / Fragment / Lifecycle

Navigation / Toolbar / Menu

RecyclerView / DiffUtil

ViewModel, LiveData (Jetpack architectural components)

Retrofit - working with the network

SharedPreferences, Room - for working with a local database.

Intent, BroadcastReceiver, FileProvider

Permissions (runtime)

Working with camera, contacts, images, audio

Background work: WorkManager

Dependency management (Gradle)

During independent exercises I had to face the fact that the data from the book was outdated and 
I had to learn new technologies (for example, coroutines, flows, etc.)
